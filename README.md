<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>
<p>The osTicket ticket lifecycle consists of four main stages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Intake:</strong> Capturing and creating a ticket.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment and Communication:</strong> Assigning the ticket and initiating communication with the customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Working the Issue:</strong> Resolving the issue based on research, troubleshooting, or collaboration.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Closing the ticket after confirming resolution with the customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3>1. Intake</h3>
<p>The intake stage is where the support request is captured in the system. This can occur in various ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Via the web portal, where users can submit support tickets.</li>
    <li>Through email, if the system is set up to accept tickets submitted via email.</li>
    <li>Manually by agents who log tickets created through phone or chat interactions with the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the intake process, essential details such as the user's information, a description of the issue, priority level, and any supporting attachments are gathered. This ensures that the ticket is categorized and routed appropriately for resolution.</p>

<h3>2. Assignment and Communication</h3>
<p>After a ticket is created, it needs to be assigned to the appropriate agent or department for further handling. This assignment can be done manually or automatically, depending on the configuration of the system. Once the ticket is assigned, the agent begins communication with the customer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirming ticket receipt and offering initial feedback or action items.</li>
    <li>Requesting further details if necessary to understand the issue more fully.</li>
    <li>Providing an estimated resolution timeframe or guidance on next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clear communication at this stage ensures the customer is informed about the status of their issue and the expected timeline for resolution.</p>

<h3>3. Working the Issue</h3>
<p>During this stage, the agent works on resolving the issue. This may involve the following actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Searching the knowledge base or reviewing previous tickets to find possible solutions.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with other agents or departments if the issue requires expertise outside the agent’s area.</li>
    <li>Implementing a solution or troubleshooting steps to fix the reported issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this stage, agents may need to update the customer on progress or request additional information to resolve the issue. Regular updates help manage the customer's expectations.</p>

<h3>4. Resolution</h3>
<p>Once the issue has been resolved, the agent closes the ticket. However, before closing the ticket, the agent should ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirm that the solution fully resolves the customer’s issue and that no further assistance is needed.</li>
    <li>Verify with the customer, if necessary, to ensure they are satisfied with the resolution.</li>
    <li>Document the resolution process, including any solutions or actions taken, for future reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>After confirming with the customer, the agent can officially close the ticket. This marks the end of the ticket lifecycle, although feedback from the customer may lead to additional follow-up actions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The osTicket ticket lifecycle ensures that support requests are handled systematically and efficiently. By following these stages, support teams can provide organized, timely, and effective service, improving customer satisfaction and reducing response times.</p>
